Project 2: Landing Page


Overview

This is the second project in The Odin Project curriculum, where I'm learning to build a landing page similar to the design provided by the course. The goal is to create a functional webpage that accurately replicates the design and user experience, using HTML and CSS.



Objectives

- Understand how to create a basic layout structure using HTML
- Master CSS selectors, properties, and values
- Implement CSS styles to achieve the desired visual design



Design Inspiration

The design for this project was provided by The Odin Project and can be found at [https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png]. 
My goal is to recreate this design exactly, using HTML and CSS.



Project Status

I'm just starting out on this project! I'm excited to get started and make progress over the coming days/weeks.
